# Button Debouncing Solution - Technical Analysis

## Problem Summary

The Neokey button exhibited a "stuck choke" issue where the choke effect would remain engaged even after releasing the button. This occurred most frequently with fast, light "half-presses" that didn't fully engage the mechanical switch.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Fundamental Issue: State Desynchronization

The problem was **not** traditional contact bounce, but rather **state tracking desynchronization** caused by:

1. **Half-press behavior**: Light, fast button presses would cause the mechanical contacts to make brief, unstable contact
2. **Bounce during debounce period**: When a bounce occurred within the debounce window (50ms), the original algorithm would:
   - Detect a state change
   - **Reject the event** (correctly, due to debounce timer)
   - **But fail to update `lastKeyState`** to match the new hardware state
3. **Cascading desync**: Once `lastKeyState` diverged from actual hardware state, subsequent button presses would be interpreted incorrectly

### Example Failure Scenario (Original Algorithm)

```
Time  | Hardware State | lastKeyState | Event Sent | Problem
------|----------------|--------------|------------|------------------
0ms   | Released (0)   | 0            | -          | ✓ In sync
10ms  | Pressed (1)    | 1            | PRESS      | ✓ First press works
30ms  | Bounced (0)    | 1            | (ignored)  | ✗ Debounce rejects, BUT lastKeyState not updated!
80ms  | Released (0)   | 1            | RELEASE    | ✗ WRONG! Sends release when already released
```

**Result**: The system thinks the button is still pressed (lastKeyState=1), but hardware is released (0). LED stays red, audio stays choked.

## Failed Approaches (What Didn't Work)

### Approach 1: Wait-and-Verify
```cpp
// Wait 10ms, then re-read to confirm stable state
delay(10);
if (neokey.read() == initialState) { /* send event */ }
```
**Why it failed**: 10ms wasn't long enough for half-presses to settle. Button might still be bouncing.

### Approach 2: Multi-Sample Verification
```cpp
// Take 5 samples, 10ms apart, require all to match
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    delay(10);
    if (neokey.read() != expectedState) { unstable = true; }
}
```
**Why it failed**:
- Total 50ms verification time made the button feel sluggish and unresponsive
- Still didn't prevent state desync if the button changed state during verification

### Approach 3: Always Update State After Verification
```cpp
if (stablePressed != lastKeyState) {
    lastKeyState = stablePressed;  // Update even if no event sent
}
```
**Why it failed**: Better than original, but still had timing issues with continuous polling needed

## The Solution: Always-Trust-Hardware Polling

### Core Principle
**"The hardware is always right. Software state must always match hardware state."**

### Implementation
```cpp
for (;;) {
    // 1. Poll hardware every 5ms (continuous sync)
    uint32_t buttons = neokey.read();
    bool keyPressed = (buttons & (1 << CHOKE_KEY)) != 0;

    // 2. Detect state change
    if (keyPressed != lastKeyState) {
        uint32_t now = millis();

        // 3. Send event only if debounce period passed
        if (now - lastEventTime >= DEBOUNCE_MS) {
            lastKeyState = keyPressed;
            lastEventTime = now;
            sendEvent(keyPressed);
        } else {
            // 4. CRITICAL: Update state even if we don't send event
            lastKeyState = keyPressed;
        }
    }

    threads.delay(5);  // Poll every 5ms
}
```

### Key Differences from Original

| Aspect | Original (Broken) | New Solution (Working) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Polling strategy** | Only on INT pin LOW | Continuous every 5ms |
| **State update** | Only when event sent | **Always** on state change |
| **Debouncing** | Complex multi-sample verification | Simple time threshold (20ms) |
| **State sync** | Could desync during bounces | **Always in sync** with hardware |
| **Responsiveness** | Variable (10-100ms depending on approach) | Consistent ~20-25ms |

### Why This Works

1. **Continuous polling** (every 5ms): System reads actual button state constantly
2. **Immediate state tracking**: `lastKeyState` **always** matches hardware, even during debounce period
3. **Event rate limiting**: Events only sent every 20ms minimum (prevents spam from bounces)
4. **Self-correcting**: If a half-press bounces back, `lastKeyState` immediately updates to match

**Example with new algorithm:**
```
Time  | Hardware State | lastKeyState | Event Sent | Status
------|----------------|--------------|------------|------------------
0ms   | Released (0)   | 0            | -          | ✓ In sync
10ms  | Pressed (1)    | 1            | PRESS      | ✓ Event sent
15ms  | Bounced (0)    | 0            | (none)     | ✓ State updated, no event (within 20ms)
25ms  | Pressed (1)    | 1            | PRESS      | ✓ Event sent (20ms passed)
30ms  | Released (0)   | 0            | (none)     | ✓ State updated, no event (within 20ms)
50ms  | Still rel. (0) | 0            | -          | ✓ Stable, in sync
```

**Result**: Button state always matches hardware. No stuck choke.

## Performance Analysis

### CPU Impact
- **I2C reads**: ~200-500µs per read @ 400kHz
- **Polling frequency**: Every 5ms = 200 reads/second
- **Total CPU**: ~0.1ms/sec = **0.01% CPU usage**
- **Teensy 4.1 headroom**: 99.99% free for other features

### I2C Bus Impact
- **Wire (I2C0)**: Used by SGTL5000 codec (infrequent config writes)
- **Wire2 (I2C2)**: Used by Neokey (200 reads/sec)
- **Separate buses**: Zero contention
- **Wire2 bandwidth**: 400kHz = 50KB/s, using ~2KB/s (4%)

### Latency Breakdown
1. **Button press** → 0ms (user action)
2. **Next poll** → 0-5ms (worst case: just missed the poll)
3. **I2C read** → 0.5ms (transaction time)
4. **Queue push** → <0.01ms (lock-free)
5. **App thread wakes** → 0-2ms (thread scheduling)
6. **Audio ISR picks up** → 0-2.9ms (next audio block)
7. **Fade starts** → 0ms (immediate)

**Total latency**: ~10-15ms (button press to audio mute start)
**Perceived latency**: ~20-25ms (including 10ms fade)

### Memory Impact
- **Code size**: ~500 bytes (simplified logic vs complex verification)
- **RAM**: No additional buffers needed
- **Stack**: 2KB thread stack (unchanged)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Trust the Hardware
Complex debouncing algorithms that try to "outsmart" mechanical bounces often fail when the real issue is state synchronization. **Always keep software state in sync with hardware state.**

### 2. Separate Concerns
- **State tracking**: Should always match hardware (updated on every read)
- **Event generation**: Can be rate-limited independently (debounce timer)

These are two separate concerns that should be handled separately.

### 3. Polling vs Interrupts
For this use case, **continuous polling** is superior to interrupt-driven approaches:
- Simpler code (no complex ISR coordination)
- Self-correcting (always re-syncs to hardware)
- Negligible CPU cost on modern MCUs (Teensy 4.1 @ 600MHz)
- More reliable for mechanical switches with unstable contacts

### 4. Real-World Testing Matters
The "half-press" failure mode only appeared during actual performance use. Bench testing with deliberate full presses never triggered the bug. **Always test with realistic usage patterns.**

## Design Trade-offs

### Advantages of Current Approach
✅ **Robust**: Cannot get stuck in wrong state (self-correcting)
✅ **Simple**: ~30 lines of code vs ~60+ for verification logic
✅ **Predictable**: Consistent 20-25ms latency
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and debug
✅ **Scalable**: Adding more buttons requires minimal code duplication

### Potential Concerns (Addressed)
❓ **"Isn't continuous polling wasteful?"**
→ No. 0.01% CPU usage is negligible. Modern MCUs are fast enough.

❓ **"What about I2C bus contention?"**
→ Neokey uses Wire2, codec uses Wire (separate buses). No contention.

❓ **"Could we still use interrupts for efficiency?"**
→ Possible, but not worth complexity. Current approach uses <1% CPU with room for 100+ buttons.

❓ **"What if we add more features?"**
→ Teensy 4.1 has 99.99% CPU headroom. Not a concern.

## Recommendations

### Current Implementation: Keep As-Is
The current approach is optimal for this use case. No changes needed.

### If Adding More Buttons (Future)
Use the same polling approach for all buttons:
```cpp
// Read all 4 keys in one I2C transaction
uint32_t allButtons = neokey.read();
bool key0 = allButtons & 0x01;
bool key1 = allButtons & 0x02;
bool key2 = allButtons & 0x04;
bool key3 = allButtons & 0x08;
```
**Cost**: Still just 200 I2C reads/sec (unchanged), handles 4 buttons.

### If CPU Becomes Constrained (Unlikely)
Only then consider optimizations:
1. Increase poll interval to 10ms (still responsive, halves I2C traffic)
2. Use INT pin to sleep thread when no activity (more complex, minimal gain)

### Configuration Tuning
Current settings are well-balanced:
- `DEBOUNCE_MS = 20`: Good balance of responsiveness vs bounce rejection
- `threads.delay(5)`: Good polling rate for mechanical switches

**Do not decrease below:**
- DEBOUNCE_MS < 10ms (mechanical switches need time to settle)
- delay < 3ms (diminishing returns, increases I2C traffic)

## Conclusion

The solution demonstrates that **simple, continuous polling with proper state synchronization** is often superior to complex event-driven debouncing for mechanical switches, especially on modern high-performance microcontrollers like the Teensy 4.1.

**Key takeaway**: Keep software state synchronized with hardware state at all times. Debounce events, not state.
