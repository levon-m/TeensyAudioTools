/**
 * @brief Lock-free Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) Ring Buffer
 *
 * REAL-TIME SAFE: This queue is designed for real-time audio/MIDI applications.
 *
 * KEY PROPERTIES:
 * - Lock-free: No mutexes, no blocking, no priority inversion
 * - Wait-free: Both producer and consumer complete in bounded time
 * - Cache-friendly: Uses power-of-2 size for fast modulo (bit masking)
 * - POD only: Works with Plain Old Data types (no constructors/destructors)
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * - Two indices: writeIdx (producer) and readIdx (consumer)
 * - Producer only writes to writeIdx, consumer only writes to readIdx
 * - Both can READ each other's index (volatile ensures memory visibility)
 * - No data races because only one thread writes to each index
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * - Push/Pop: O(1) constant time
 * - No dynamic allocation after construction
 * - Uses bitwise AND instead of modulo: (index & (SIZE-1)) vs (index % SIZE)
 *   Why? AND is single CPU cycle, modulo can be dozens of cycles
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * - SIZE must be power of 2 (enforced at compile time)
 * - Only POD types (no std::string, no complex objects)
 * - Single producer, single consumer only (NOT thread-safe for multiple producers/consumers)
 *
 * TYPICAL USE:
 * - ISR → Thread: Audio samples, MIDI clock ticks
 * - Thread → ISR: Control commands (be careful with priority inversion!)
 * - Thread → Thread: Events, processed data
 *
 * @tparam T Element type (must be POD: Plain Old Data)
 * @tparam SIZE Number of elements (MUST be power of 2: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.)
